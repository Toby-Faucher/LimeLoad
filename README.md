## `base.py` Improvement TODO List

This list focuses exclusively on enhancing the `load_balancer/algorithms/base.py` file, improving the core ABC, data structures, and overall robustness of the foundation for all load balancing algorithms.

### 1. Performance Optimizations

-   [x] **Server Storage Mechanism**:
    -   **Problem**: Currently, servers are stored in a `List[Server[ServerType]]`. Operations like `get_server`, `remove_server`, and `update_server_metrics` require iterating through the list, resulting in O(n) time complexity. This is inefficient for a large number of servers.
    -   **Solution**: Refactor `self.servers` to be a `Dict[str, Server[ServerType]]`, where the key is the `server.id`. This will reduce the lookup, removal, and update times to O(1) on average, significantly improving performance as the server pool scales. This change will require updating all methods that interact with the `self.servers` list.

-   [ ] **Efficient Healthy Server Retrieval**:
    -   **Problem**: The `get_healthy_servers` method iterates through all servers every time it's called. If called frequently, this can be a performance bottleneck.
    -   **Solution**: Maintain a separate `Set[str]` or `Dict[str, Server[ServerType]]` containing only the healthy servers. This set would be updated whenever a server's status changes (via the `on_server_status_updated` hook). This provides an O(1) lookup for the healthy server collection, though it adds a small overhead to status updates.

### 2. Concurrency and Thread Safety

-   [ ] **Implement Locking for Shared State**:
    -   **Problem**: The `LoadBalancingAlgorithm` class is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access the server list (e.g., one thread adding a server while another is selecting one), it can lead to race conditions and inconsistent state.
    -   **Solution**: Introduce a `threading.Lock` or `asyncio.Lock` to protect critical sections that modify shared state, such as `self.servers` and `self.statistics`. Methods like `add_server`, `remove_server`, and `select_server` should acquire the lock before accessing these shared resources.

### 3. ABC and API Design Enhancements

-   [ ] **Refine Abstract Method Contracts**:
    -   **Problem**: The current abstract methods are minimal. Their contracts could be more explicit to guide implementers.
    -   **Solution**: Review and potentially expand the docstrings for `select_server`, `add_server`, and `remove_server` to be more prescriptive about expected behavior, including edge cases (e.g., what should happen if `add_server` is called with a duplicate server ID?). Consider if any helper methods should also be abstract.

-   [ ] **State Management Hooks**:
    -   **Problem**: The hooks (`on_server_added`, etc.) are useful but could be more powerful.
    -   **Solution**: Consider implementing a more formal event dispatcher or observer pattern. This would allow multiple components to listen for events (like `server_added`) without modifying the base class, promoting better separation of concerns.

### 4. Configuration and Flexibility

-   [ ] **Decouple Hardcoded Values**:
    -   **Problem**: The `ServerMetrics.is_stale` method has a hardcoded `threshold` of 30 seconds.
    -   **Solution**: Abstract this value out. Pass a configuration object or dictionary during the `LoadBalancingAlgorithm` initialization. This configuration could hold values like the staleness threshold, logging levels, and other tunable parameters, making the base class more flexible.

### 5. Data Structure and Validation Improvements

-   [ ] **Immutable Data Classes**:
    -   **Problem**: The dataclasses (`Server`, `ServerMetrics`, `LoadBalancingContext`) are mutable. In a concurrent environment or complex system, this can lead to unexpected side effects where data is changed unintentionally.
    -   **Solution**: Evaluate making some of these dataclasses immutable by setting `frozen=True`. This is particularly relevant for `LoadBalancingContext`, which represents a snapshot in time. This change would force more explicit state updates and can help prevent bugs.

-   [ ] **Enhanced Server Validation**:
    -   **Problem**: The `_validate_server` method is basic. It doesn't prevent invalid servers from being added if a subclass forgets to call it.
    -   **Solution**: Integrate the validation logic directly into `add_server` within the base class, making it non-abstract. Subclasses can still override it but will have a safe default. Raise a specific `ValueError` or a custom exception (e.g., `InvalidServerConfiguration`) if validation fails to provide clearer error feedback.

## Current Objective List

### Advanced Load Balancing Algorithms
- [x] Research and select specific advanced load balancing algorithms (e.g., Least Connections, Weighted Round Robin, IP Hash).
- [ ] Design a common interface or abstract base class for new load balancing algorithms (e.g., `load_balancer/algorithms/base.py`). *currently working on!*
- [ ] Implement each selected algorithm as a separate class/module within `load_balancer/algorithms/` (e.g., `least_connections.py`, `weighted_round_robin.py`).
- [ ] Modify the main load balancer logic (`main.py` or `pool.py`) to dynamically select and use the chosen algorithm.
- [ ] Consider adding a configuration mechanism (e.g., a new `config.py` file or extending `main.py`'s argument parsing) to allow users to specify the desired algorithm.
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for each new load balancing algorithm to ensure correctness and cover edge cases (e.g., `tests/test_algorithms.py`).
- [ ] Update the `README.md` with documentation on how to configure and use the new load balancing algorithms.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Backend Management**: Allow adding/removing backends at runtime without restarting the load balancer.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O to handle more concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Configuration File**: Externalize backend configurations into a file (e.g., YAML, JSON) for easier management.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging for requests, errors, and backend health, and integrate with monitoring tools.
- **HTTPS Support**: Implement SSL/TLS termination for secure communication.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement a circuit breaker to prevent requests from being sent to unhealthy backends, allowing them time to recover.
- **Rate Limiting**: Add the ability to limit the number of requests per client or per backend.
- **Caching**: Implement a caching mechanism to serve frequently requested content directly from the load balancer.
- **Health Check Improvements**: More robust health checks, including custom health check endpoints and different protocols (e.g., TCP, ICMP).
