## `base.py` Improvement TODO List

This list focuses exclusively on enhancing the `load_balancer/algorithms/base.py` file, improving the core ABC, data structures, and overall robustness of the foundation for all load balancing algorithms.

### 1. ABC and API Design Enhancements

-   [ ] **State Management Hooks**:
    -   **Problem**: The hooks (`on_server_added`, etc.) are useful but could be more powerful.
    -   **Solution**: Consider implementing a more formal event dispatcher or observer pattern. This would allow multiple components to listen for events (like `server_added`) without modifying the base class, promoting better separation of concerns.

### 2. Configuration and Flexibility

-   [ ] **Decouple Hardcoded Values**:
    -   **Problem**: The `ServerMetrics.is_stale` method has a hardcoded `threshold` of 30 seconds.
    -   **Solution**: Abstract this value out. Pass a configuration object or dictionary during the `LoadBalancingAlgorithm` initialization. This configuration could hold values like the staleness threshold, logging levels, and other tunable parameters, making the base class more flexible.

### 3. Data Structure and Validation Improvements

-   [ ] **Immutable Data Classes**:
    -   **Problem**: The dataclasses (`Server`, `ServerMetrics`, `LoadBalancingContext`) are mutable. In a concurrent environment or complex system, this can lead to unexpected side effects where data is changed unintentionally.
    -   **Solution**: Evaluate making some of these dataclasses immutable by setting `frozen=True`. This is particularly relevant for `LoadBalancingContext`, which represents a snapshot in time. This change would force more explicit state updates and can help prevent bugs.

-   [ ] **Enhanced Server Validation**:
    -   **Problem**: The `_validate_server` method is basic. It doesn't prevent invalid servers from being added if a subclass forgets to call it.
    -   **Solution**: Integrate the validation logic directly into `add_server` within the base class, making it non-abstract. Subclasses can still override it but will have a safe default. Raise a specific `ValueError` or a custom exception (e.g., `InvalidServerConfiguration`) if validation fails to provide clearer error feedback.

## Current Objective List

### Advanced Load Balancing Algorithms
- [x] Research and select specific advanced load balancing algorithms (e.g., Least Connections, Weighted Round Robin, IP Hash).
- [ ] Design a common interface or abstract base class for new load balancing algorithms (e.g., `load_balancer/algorithms/base.py`). *currently working on!*
- [ ] Implement each selected algorithm as a separate class/module within `load_balancer/algorithms/` (e.g., `least_connections.py`, `weighted_round_robin.py`).
- [ ] Modify the main load balancer logic (`main.py` or `pool.py`) to dynamically select and use the chosen algorithm.
- [ ] Consider adding a configuration mechanism (e.g., a new `config.py` file or extending `main.py`'s argument parsing) to allow users to specify the desired algorithm.
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for each new load balancing algorithm to ensure correctness and cover edge cases (e.g., `tests/test_algorithms.py`).
- [ ] Update the `README.md` with documentation on how to configure and use the new load balancing algorithms.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Backend Management**: Allow adding/removing backends at runtime without restarting the load balancer.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O to handle more concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Configuration File**: Externalize backend configurations into a file (e.g., YAML, JSON) for easier management.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging for requests, errors, and backend health, and integrate with monitoring tools.
- **HTTPS Support**: Implement SSL/TLS termination for secure communication.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement a circuit breaker to prevent requests from being sent to unhealthy backends, allowing them time to recover.
- **Rate Limiting**: Add the ability to limit the number of requests per client or per backend.
- **Caching**: Implement a caching mechanism to serve frequently requested content directly from the load balancer.
- **Health Check Improvements**: More robust health checks, including custom health check endpoints and different protocols (e.g., TCP, ICMP).
